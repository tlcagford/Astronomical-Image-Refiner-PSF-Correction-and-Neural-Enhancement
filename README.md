# Astronomical Image Refiner: PSF Correction & Neural Enhancement

**"HST-to-JWST Image Processor: 13-year PSF characterization meets next-gen mosaicking for precision multi-mission astronomy"**


## 🚀 What Is This?

Astronomical Image Refiner is a software framework designed to improve the quality of telescope images by combining **point spread function (PSF)** correction with **neural network–based image enhancement**. The goal is to recover fine spatial details in astronomical data—especially when combining images from different missions like Hubble (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

This tool enables:  
- **PSF correction:** Use physically or empirically derived PSFs to deconvolve blurred images.  
- **Neural enhancement:** Deep learning models enhance structures (stars, galaxies, nebulae) while suppressing noise and artifacts.  
- **Multi-mission processing:** Integrate data from different space telescopes for unified, high-resolution mosaics.  
- **Precision science:** Produce scientifically meaningful images suitable for photometry, morphological studies, and more.
