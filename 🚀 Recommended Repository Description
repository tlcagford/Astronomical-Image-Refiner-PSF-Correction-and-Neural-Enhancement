# Astro-PSF-Symmetry-Mapper: HST & JWST Image Processing Suite

**Advanced astronomical image processing combining 13 years of HST/WFC3 PSF characterization with JWST mosaicking pipelines for precision astronomy in the JWST era.**

## 🔬 What This Does

A comprehensive toolkit that merges two powerful astronomical imaging technologies:

- **HST/WFC3 IR Point Spread Function**: 13-year empirical PSF characterization for precision photometry
- **JWST-Merge**: Advanced MIRI and NIRCam image mosaicking and alignment
- **Symmetry-based mapping** for optimal image combination and artifact reduction

## 🌟 Key Features

### HST/WFC3 PSF Module
- 13-year empirical PSF database for WFC3/IR
- Time-dependent PSF modeling
- Precision astrometry and photometry corrections
- JWST-era calibration standards

### JWST Mosaicking Pipeline  
- MIRI and NIRCam image combination
- Advanced dither pattern reconstruction
- Background matching and gradient removal
- Cosmic ray rejection optimized for JWST

### Symmetry Mapping Engine
- Neural symmetry detection for optimal alignment
- PSF-constrained image combination
- Artifact identification and mitigation
- Multi-instrument cross-calibration

## 🛠 Use Cases

- **JWST data reduction** with HST-calibrated PSF models
- **Multi-epoch HST+JWST** combined analysis
- **Precision photometry** for exoplanet studies
- **Deep field mosaicking** with optimal SNR
- **Instrument cross-calibration** between HST and JWST

## 📥 Quick Start

```python
from astro_psf_mapper import HST_PSF_Characterizer, JWST_Mosaic_Engine

# Load 13-year HST PSF characterization
psf_model = HST_PSF_Characterizer('wfc3_ir')

# Create JWST mosaic with HST-optimized PSF
mosaic_engine = JWST_Mosaic_engine(psf_model=psf_model)
combined_image = mosaic_engine.process_jwst_data(nircam_data, miri_data)
