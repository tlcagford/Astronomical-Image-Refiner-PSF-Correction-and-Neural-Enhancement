## 🚀 What Is This?

Astronomical Image Refiner is a software framework designed to improve the quality of telescope images by combining **point spread function (PSF)** correction with **neural network–based image enhancement**. The goal is to recover fine spatial details in astronomical data—especially when combining images from different missions like Hubble (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

This tool enables:  
- **PSF correction:** Use physically or empirically derived PSFs to deconvolve blurred images.  
- **Neural enhancement:** Deep learning models enhance structures (stars, galaxies, nebulae) while suppressing noise and artifacts.  
- **Multi-mission processing:** Integrate data from different space telescopes for unified, high-resolution mosaics.  
- **Precision science:** Produce scientifically meaningful images suitable for photometry, morphological studies, and more.

## 📚 Why It Matters

- **PSF degradation** (due to optics + atmosphere) limits image sharpness. Deconvolution helps, but classical methods can amplify noise.  
- Neural networks can learn to “undo” blur while preserving real astrophysical structure, based on training on realistic simulations or calibration data. Similar approaches have been published in the literature. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- By combining **13 years of calibration** (e.g. from HST) with modern deep learning, this project makes high-fidelity image reconstruction more robust and accessible.

## 🔧 Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **PSF Estimation** | Characterize and model PSFs over time or spatially across the field. |
| **Deconvolution** | Use PSF models to reverse blurring (non-blind deconvolution). |
| **Neural Enhancement** | Use neural nets (e.g., U-Net, CNNs) to sharpen and clean images. |
| **Mosaicking** | Generate mosaics from multi-mission data with consistent resolution. |
| **CLI + Notebook Support** | Run from the command line, or explore via Jupyter notebooks. |
| **Extensible** | Easily add new PSF models, network architectures, or datasets. |
